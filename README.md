Exploring Multi-Camera Object Mapping with OpenCV
üöÄ Transform Your Video Processing with Multi-Camera Stitching and Object Mapping!

I‚Äôm excited to share a practical example of using OpenCV to stitch multiple camera feeds and track objects across different views. This Python script processes video from two cameras, performs perspective warping, and combines the frames into a unified output. Here's a deep dive into the key components:

Setup and Initialization:
We start by setting up the OpenCV environment and loading the video file. A canvas is prepared to visualize the output, and a codec is defined for saving the results.
Processing Frames:
Frame Capture: Each frame is extracted from the video.
Region of Interest (ROI): Areas corresponding to each camera's view are isolated.
Warping: Each frame is warped to align with a common perspective.
Combining: The warped frames are merged into one view.
Mapping and Visualization:
Movement Mapping: A room map is generated to highlight movement within the video.
Canvas Construction: Input from each camera and the room map are combined into a single canvas for easy comparison.
Display and Save:
The canvas is displayed in a window, and the processed frames are saved to a video file.
The process continues until the user decides to end it.
